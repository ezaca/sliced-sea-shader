# Sea Shader

This is a shader I made for fun while playing with the Unity Shader Graph.
The repository does not include the source code itself for now.

The landscape pictures are downloaded from [Pixabay](pixabay.com) and the whale was taken from the [Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/fish/humpback-whale-3547).
